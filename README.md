# Evolutionary Constrained Reinforcement Learning
This is the implementation of the paper "Evolving Constrained Reinforcement Learning Policy" accepted by the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) in 2023. The algorithm is adapted from [Tianshou](https://github.com/thu-) and [original ERL](https://github.com/ShawK91/Evolutionary-Reinforcement-Learning).
